    <string name="certificate_long_text">At the beginning of my programming journey, I spent my time watching, reading, and finishing certificates. Finishing my certificates was a big part of my journey in programming because it taught me the basics of Android programming and the programming itself. One certificate I am hopeful to finish is the ‘Google Developers Certification’ which is given by Google when you finish an exam. I am constantly learning how to develop Android Applications and I hope the list would continue.</string>
    <string name="project_long_text">After I learned the basics of programming, I started to create my own projects. This is the time that I would apply everything that I have learned, and I make each project more complex that the previous one. I love making Android applications because it is the best time to showcase your skills and it would introduce you to multiple problems and you must think creatively to solve it. Creating Android applications was the biggest contributor to my journey as an Android developer.</string>
